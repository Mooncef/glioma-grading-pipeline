# Glioma Grading with Clinical and Genomic Features

**Classifying Brain Tumor Types (LGG vs GBM) using Clinical and Mutation Data from TCGA.**

> A real-world ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model explainability â€“ with clinical impact.


## Project Overview

This project tackles a **high-stakes healthcare problem**: grading gliomas (brain tumors) as either  
**Lower Grade Glioma (LGG)** or **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)** using:

- **Clinical features**: Gender, Age at diagnosis, Race  
- **Genetic markers**: 20 most frequently mutated genes

The goal is to design an **accurate and cost-efficient classifier** by identifying the **optimal subset of features** to support diagnosis and reduce unnecessary testing costs.


## What I Did

**End-to-end ML workflow**:
- **Data understanding**: distribution analysis, missing values, feature types
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: imputation, encoding, scaling
- **Train/test split**: 80/20 + stratification

**Modeling & Evaluation**:
- Baseline: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree  
- Advanced: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: GridSearchCV on 10-fold cross-validation
- **Model evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC/AUC, PR Curves

**Explainability**:
- Feature importance analysis from decision tree & random forest
- Visual diagnostics (ROC, Precision-Recall, confusion matrices)

**Deliverables**:
- Final predictions on new test data (`test.xlsx`)
- Complete code in reproducible Jupyter Notebook
